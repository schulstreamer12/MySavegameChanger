# MySavegameChanger
Tool to swap the Savegames from MSC.
#This project is unfinished
It cann not copy the savegames, and cant read the saved titles and descriptions!
Its not sure if it work on all computers, when you want to help me, test it on your system, and write an
issue report when something of the implemented function dont work ;D

#Idea
Because of the default Game dont bring the option to have multiple saves I write this programm, to easily 
change the games without copy around files and mess them up.
You can add a title and description to every savegame.
